# dlw

<!-- badges: start -->

`{dlw}` is an R client of the internal [datalibweb](https://datalibweb2.worldbank.org/) API of the World Bank. Datalibweb is a data system designed to enable users to seamlessly access microdata and documentation in the World Bank. Users can access the most up-to-date and historical versions of harmonized data collections and raw/non-harmonized data for subsequent analysis

## Installation

You can install the development version of dlw from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("worldbank/dlw")
# or
remotes::github_install("worldbank/dlw")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dlw)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
